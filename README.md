# Crop-Prediction


This Android app was made as a part of a larger project designed to receive, analyse and determine health of a crop through a picture of its leaf. A convolutional neural network was trained and deployed to a server.

This minimaistic application has the ability to send a locally stored image to the server via the internet. The server then uses the trained model to determine crop health and sends the response back to the application which then receives and displays the results to the user
